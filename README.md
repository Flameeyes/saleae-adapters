# Saleae Adapters by Flameeyes

This repository contains a number of [Saleae Logic](https://www.saleae.com/) adapter boards, which
I (Flameeyes) designed for my own use, and decided to share with everyone else.

Note that I have no connection or partnernship with Saleae, so these boards are not officially
supported by them, and honestly not even by me.
I'll be happy to answer questions, but there's no implied support for mistakes or issues caused by
these devices.

## `trrs-mitm`

This is a simple adapter that plugs directly into the Logic (tested with Logic Pro 16, should work
with all models) and provides two TRRS (Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve) plugs, plus four breakout pins.

Note: all the components are through-hole for this particular board.
